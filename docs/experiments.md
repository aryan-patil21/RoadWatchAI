# RoadWatch AI - Experiment Log

## Experiment 01: Milestone 1 - Video Input & Frame Inspection
- **Objective**: Verify that raw dashcam footage from the ZOMAI dashcam can be decoded and processed sequentially using OpenCV, inspecting resolution, frame rate, total duration, and frame data structures.
- **Dataset**: `data/raw/sample_dashcam.mp4` (~11 MB, 1-minute real commute footage).
- **Method**: Implemented [`inspect_video`](file:///Users/apple/Desktop/RoadwatchAI/src/inspect_video.py) using `cv2.VideoCapture`. Read video properties via `cv2.CAP_PROP_*`, decoded frames at 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% marks, and verified NumPy array representation `(H, W, C)`.
- **Result**:
  - Resolution: 854 x 480 (FWVGA 16:9 widescreen)
  - Frame Rate: 25.00 FPS
  - Total Frames: 1,895 frames
  - Duration: 75.80 seconds (~1.26 minutes)
  - Successfully decoded frames into `uint8` NumPy arrays with shape `(480, 854, 3)`.
  - Extracted sample frames saved in `outputs/`.
- **Problems**: None. The video container and H.264 video stream decoded cleanly on Apple Silicon without codec missing errors.
- **Next Step**: Milestone 2 — Introduce a lightweight pretrained YOLO model (e.g., YOLOv8n) to detect vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks, autos) in each frame.
